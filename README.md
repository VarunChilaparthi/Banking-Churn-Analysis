Banking Churn Prediction
A machine learning project to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the bank) or stay, based on their account activity and profile data. This project is aimed at helping banks reduce customer attrition by identifying high-risk customers in advance.

Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Analyze customer data from a bank

Build a predictive model that classifies customers into Churn or No Churn

Help banks take proactive retention actions

Dataset
The dataset contains various customer-related features such as:

Customer ID

Credit Score

Geography

Gender

Age

Tenure

Balance

Number of Products

Has Credit Card

Is Active Member

Estimated Salary

Exited (Target Variable)

Note: The dataset used is for academic purposes and may be synthetic or anonymized.
